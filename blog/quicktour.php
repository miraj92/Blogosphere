<p> <lable> We created Blogger to give you an easy way 

to share your thoughts — about current 

events, what's going on in your life, or 

anything else you'd care to discuss — with 

the world. We've developed a host of 

features to make blogging as simple and 

effective as possible.

<b>What's a blog?</b><br />

A blog is a personal diary. A daily 

pulpit. A collaborative space. A political 

soapbox. A breaking-news outlet. A 

collection of links. Your own private 

thoughts. Memos to the world.

Your blog is whatever you want it to be. 

There are millions of them, in all shapes 

and sizes, and there are no real rules.

In simple terms, a blog is a website, 

where you write stuff on an ongoing basis. 

New stuff shows up at the top, so your 

visitors can read what's new. Then they 

comment on it or link to it or email you. 

Or not.


<br />

<b>Publish your thoughts</b><br />

A blog gives you your own voice on the 

web. It is a place to collect and share 

things that you find interesting – whether 

it is your political commentary, a 

personal diary or links to websites that 

you want to remember.

Many people use a blog just to organise 

their own thoughts, while others command 

influential, worldwide audiences of 

thousands. Professional and amateur 

journalists use blogs to publish breaking 

news, while personal journalers reveal 

inner thoughts.

Whatever you have to say, Blogger can help 

you say it.


<br />



<b>Engage your friends</b><br />

Blogging is about more than just putting 

your thoughts on the web. It's about 

connecting with and hearing from anyone 

who reads your work. With Blogger, you 

control who can read and write to your 

blog – let just a few friends or the 

entire world see what you have to say!

Blogger Comments let anyone, anywhere, 

offer feedback on your posts. You can 

choose whether you want to allow comments 

on a post-by-post basis and you can delete 

comments that you don't like.

Access Controls let you decide who can 

read and who can write to your blog.
